#Exploritory NMDS to visualize community differences

#rm() removes all designated objects, this pervents confusion with any previous data you've been working with before running this code
#if you are begining a new R session, this is not necessary, but it won't hurt anything to run it
rm(list=ls())

#libarary() will open the packages necessary for the commands we will be using in this code
#if you do not have these packages intalled, you may intall through the menu or by running install.pacakges()
#You only need to install packages once, they need only be opened each time you start a new R session

#For this exploritory NMDS, you will not need taxonomic information
#Read in the dataset, file.choose() will open a window from which you can select your data file (shold be .csv created in
#Bach_ITS_data_wrangling.R), I typically run this code for both rarified and non-rarified data to see if rarification impacted the
#ecological signal, but the non-rarified visualization is optional
#reading in non-rarified data
data.nosing.rar<-read.csv(file.choose())
head(data.nosing[,1:10])

#read in rarified data

#Start with the rarified data, this is most likely what you'll end up using
#Presence/Absence MDS
#First we will look at community structure determined by OTU presence/absence, 
#we will convert the data frame into presnece absence using decostand(), "pa"=presence/absence, again, exclude all metadata so only OTUs are used
#we will run permutations of the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm using mteaMDS(), using the Jaccard dissimilarity distance (for presence/absence data)
#we will run MDS ordinations for 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 dimensions (k), check the stress scores to determine which dimensionality best describes the data, as a rule of thumb, choose the dimensionality that represents a strong decline in stress score, additionally, anything <0.10 is a good representation of the data, 0.10-0.20 may indicate some morphing of true data distances, but if shows the community differences, is acceptable for visualization (you will run statistics seperately anyway), I figure a 2 or 3-D plot with a stress score ~0.19 is better than trying to convey 4 or more dimenisions
#generally 2 or 3 dimensions is all humans can comprehend, if there is a strong reason you need to include 4 or more dimensions, please discuss with collleagues and/or statistician

#To determine if your community types are statistically different, see Bach_ITS1_multivariate.R
#In a manuscript you will produce an NMDS to visualze differences, but the multivariate statistics will be need to be reported to varify differences are "real" (at least statistically)
#You can also incorporate correlations with community structure with taxa and environmental variables collected in your dataset, see Bach_NMDS_TaxaEnv.R to perform these analyses and plot corresponding vectors on the NMDS figure
